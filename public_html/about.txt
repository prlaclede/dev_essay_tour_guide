Tour Fredericksburg, Virginia stems from English 312, Creative Writing: Nonfiction,
at the University of Mary Washington. Each semester, as students learn about the 
genre that creates art out of the facts of the real world, we hope that one result is 
that they restore wonder to the quotidian, that they begin to see everything—even 
their very surroundings—with new, fresh eyes. To that end, one assignment in this 
course asks students to compose an essay about a local site of their choice. Students 
may use any form of nonfiction they have studied, and the essays range from lyric 
rumination to straightforward travel guide. Hopefully, as you read along, you’ll see 
our town in fresh ways, too. And hopefully you might even be inspired to stop in for 
a visit. We wish you happy travels.
